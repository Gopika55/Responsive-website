        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet.The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.HyperText Markup Language is the computer language that facilitates website creation. 
        The language, which has code words and syntax just like any other language, is relatively easy to comprehend and, as time goes on, increasingly powerful in what it allows someone to create. HTML continues to evolve to meet the demands and requirements of the Internet under the guise of the 
        World Wide Web Consortium,Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<"and">" characters) is referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.HyperText
        is the method by which Internet users navigate the web.By clicking on special text called hyperlinks, users are brought to new pages. The use of hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the Internet simply by clicking on the available links. Markup is what HTML tags do to the 
        text inside of them; they mark it as a specific type of text. For example, markup text could come in the form of boldface or italicized type to draw specific attention to a word or phrase.
